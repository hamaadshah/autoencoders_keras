# Automatic feature engineering using deep learning and Bayesian inference

We will explore the use of autoencoders for automatic feature engineering. The idea is to automatically learn a set of features from a large unlabelled dataset that can then be useful in a supervised learning task where perhaps the number of labels are few.
